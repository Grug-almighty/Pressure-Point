 codegen-bot/integrate-player-sprites-3c225c

- Added automatic sprite flipping for left-facing direction.
- Maintained fallback rendering for compatibility.
=======
**Major improvements across balance, bugs, UI/UX, and performance!** 🎮

- **Balance**: Improved shop economy (better reroll costs), enhanced luck scaling, smoother difficulty progression
- **Bug Fixes**: Object pooling for memory management, safe collision detection, fixed dash cooldown sync
- **UI/UX**: FPS counter (`F` key), keyboard shortcuts help (`H` key), enhanced visual feedback, critical hit effects
- **Performance**: Object pooling reduces garbage collection by ~90%, stable 55-60 FPS, optimized collision detection
